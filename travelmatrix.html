                    Delivering environmental sustainability is enshrined as an Institutional Driver in <a href="https://www.una-europa.eu/stories/una-europa-2030-strategy-shaping-our-shared-future-for-the-better">Una Europa’s 2030 Strategy</a>. This reflects our partner universities’ commitment to reducing CO2 emissions and becoming climate neutral. One of the ways we’re working towards this as an alliance community is by making less frequent, more sustainable travel the norm.
                    <br><br>
                    You can play your part by flying less and, when you have to travel, by selecting trains as your primary mode of transport. Our Sustainable Travel Tool helps you identify the most sustainable travel route between Una Europa cities.
